## 💻 About Me

I'm a passionate full-stack web developer with a strong focus on building modern, scalable, and responsive web applications. With a solid foundation in the **MERN/MARN stack**, I bring designs to life using **React and Next.js**, and power them up with **Express** and **MongoDB** on the backend.

I love crafting seamless user experiences, building efficient RESTful APIs, and deploying production-ready apps with speed and style.
